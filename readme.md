# Welcome to CiviDisc
  
Users start with a set amount of _Rep_ and _Discs_.

  * Your rep level reflects the positive impact of your interactions on CiviDisc.  Your rep level increases from upticking discussions,  creating discussions, replying to discussions, when you are upticked, and downticking sparingly.  Excessive use of the downtick functionality will reduce your rep level.

  * Certain features are unavailable until you reach the required rep level.  These include using a custom avatar, adding a custom topic, and other features to be added in the future.

  * Your discs are a form of currency to perform actions.  Discs are gained from your discussions and posts that are upticked by other users.  Discs are spent creating discussions, posting replies, upticking, and downticking.

_CiviDisc is a "safe for work" space.  While some topics will be of a controversial or sensitive nature, users are expected to remain respectful at all times.  Personal attacks, excessively vulgar, uncivil, or hateful posts are not allowed._
