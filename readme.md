# Welcome to CiviDisc
  
Users start with a set amount of _Rep_ and _Discs_.

<li>Your rep level reflects the positive impact of
your interactions on CiviDisc.  Your rep level
increases from upticking discussions,  creating
discussions, replying to discussions, when you are
upticked, and downticking sparingly.  <strong>Excessive
use of the downtick functionality will reduce
your rep level.</strong>
</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Certain features are unavailable until you reach the required rep
level.  These include using a custom avatar,
adding a custom topic, and other features to be
added in the future.
</li> 
</p>
<p>
<li>Your discs are a form of currency to perform
actions.  Discs are gained from your discussions
and posts that are upticked by other users.
Discs are spent creating discussions, posting replies,
upticking, and downticking.
</li>

<strong>CiviDisc is a "safe for work" space.  While some topics will be of a controversial or sensitive nature, users are expected to remain
respectful at all times.  Personal attacks, excessively vulgar,
uncivil, or hateful posts are not allowed.</strong>
